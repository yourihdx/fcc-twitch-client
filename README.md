# fcc-twitch-client
## Made as a project for the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
20180204: Quite a lot a time has gone since I touched my FCC projects last time. No good!

**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/.

**User Story:** I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
**User Story:** I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
**User Story:** if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

**Hint:** See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541.
**Hint:** The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams/#get-stream-by-user.
**Hint:** Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]

**UPDATE:** Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://wind-bow.glitch.me/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.

**UPDATE** Finished the project on Feb 13th '2018, so it has taken 9 days after work and weekends, and a whole day of today, Feb 13th.
